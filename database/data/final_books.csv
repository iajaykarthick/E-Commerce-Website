What were these blond Caucasians doing in the heart of Asia? Where did they come from and what language did they speak? Might they be related to a lost tribe of Indo-Europeans known from later inscriptions?

But their clothes -- woolens that rarely survive more than a few centuries -- have been preserved as brightly hued as the day they were woven.Elizabeth Wayland Barber describes these remarkable mummies, their clothing, their shepherding ways, and their path to this remote, mysterious, and forbidding place.

0375509038,The Right Man : The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush,"The Right Man is the first inside account of a historic year in the Bush White House, by the presidential speechwriter credited with the phrase axis of evil. David Frum helped make international headlines when President George W. Bush’s 2002 State of the Union address linked international terrorists to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But that was only one moment during a crucial time in American history, when a president, an administration, and a country were transformed.Frum worked with President Bush in the Oval Office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, and studied him closely at meetings and events. He describes how Bush thinks—what this conservative president believes about religion, race, the environment, Jews, Muslims, and America’s future. Frum takes us behind the scenes of one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, with revealing portraits of Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. Most significant, he tells the story of the transformation of George W. Bush: how a president whose administration began in uncertainty became one of the most decisive, successful, and popular leaders of our time.Before becoming a White House speechwriter, David Frum was a highly regarded author of books and political commentary and an influential voice on the pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard. His commentary has been described by William F. Buckley as “the most refreshing ideological experience in a generation.” Now, in The Right Man, we see Frum as a front-row observer and participant. Not since Peggy Noonan’s account of her time in the Reagan White House has an insider portrayed a sitting president with such precision, verve, honest admiration, and insight. The Right Man will command international attention for its thoughtful account of George W. Bush in the midst of his greatest challenge. It will be an essential reference for anyone seeking to understand who our president really is and how he is likely to lead us in the future.From the Hardcover edition.",70,9,2003,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0375509038.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0679429220,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story,"Shots rang out in Savannahs grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendts sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Womans Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the soul of pampered self-absorption; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic.",60,9,1994,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0679429220.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0375500766,Care Packages : Letters to Christopher Reeve from Strangers and Other Friends,"This book is a thank-you letter. A long overdue reply to all of the people who, during one of the most difficult and painful periods my family has had to endure, took time and wrote to us; faxed us; phoned or visited us; prayed for us; joined hands for us; sent us flowers, gifts, white light, religious tokens and talismans, books, tapes, drawings, funny stories and jokes that made us laugh, tales of overcoming hardship that inspired us and gave us hope. . . .When Christopher Reeve was paralyzed in a riding accident on May 27, 1995, letters poured in from around the world, some addressed only to Superman, USA. It was an astonishing demonstration of sympathy and support for a man who had become an American icon. In Care Packages, Dana Reeve, Christophers wife, has collected some of the most unforgettable letters and gifts that her family received. There are thoughts and prayers from Hollywoods greatest stars, like Katharine Hepburn (Golly. What a mess. Call me.) and Robert De Niro, politicians and presidents, and, of course, the everyday heroes who have prevailed in the face of nearly overwhelming adversity to lead rich and fulfilling lives. These letters are inspiring, funny, surprising, and always deeply touching. Some writers offer advice (listen to jazz, try LSD psychotherapy, get a cat), while others simply tell their own stories in a beautiful gesture of hope and community. And sometimes the youngest fans say it best (Im sorry that you fell off your horse. Lets hope it wont happen again; i broke my neck....im ok now. i hope you will be too). But Care Packages is not only about the strangers and other friends who have had such a profound effect on the Reeves. With an introduction to each chapter by Dana Reeve, it is also the story of a marriage and a family facing the ultimate test--from the fear of the emergency room to the long, hard days of rehab to the bittersweet moments of a wedding anniversary--and reaffirming their commitment in a thousand new ways.",50,9,1999,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0375500766.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0679442790,The Reader,"Oprah Book Club® Selection, February 1999: Originally published in Switzerland, and gracefully translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway, The Reader is a brief tale about sex, love, reading, and shame in postwar Germany. Michael Berg is 15 when he begins a long, obsessive affair with Hanna, an enigmatic older woman. He never learns very much about her, and when she disappears one day, he expects never to see her again. But, to his horror, he does. Hanna is a defendant in a trial related to Germanys Nazi past, and it soon becomes clear that she is guilty of an unspeakable crime. As Michael follows the trial, he struggles with an overwhelming question: What should his generation do with its knowledge of the Holocaust? We should not believe we can comprehend the incomprehensible, we may not compare the incomparable.... Should we only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt? To what purpose? The Reader, which won the Boston Book Reviews Fisk Fiction Prize, wrestles with many more demons in its few, remarkably lucid pages. What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known? And is any atonement possible through literature? Schlinks prose is clean and pared down, stripped of unnecessary imagery, dialogue, and excess in any form. What remains is an austerely beautiful narrative of the attempt to breach the gap between Germanys pre- and postwar generations, between the guilty and the innocent, and between words and silence. --R.

0684848783,Tis : A Memoir,"The #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to the beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning classic memoir, Angela’s Ashes, about McCourt’s coming of age as an immigrant in America.Frank McCourts glorious childhood memoir, Angelas Ashes, has been loved and celebrated by readers everywhere for its spirit, its wit and its profound humanity. A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape.And now we have Tis, the story of Franks American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this classless country, and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Franks incomparable voice—his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue—that renders these experiences spellbinding.When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should stick to their own kind once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach—and to write—that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angelas Ashes comes of age.As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angelas Ashes, It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best. Frank McCourts Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.",30,10,1999,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0684848783.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

068484267X,Angela's Ashes: A Memoir,"Imbued on every page with Frank McCourts astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Franks mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Franks father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his fathers tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Franks survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pigs head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.

If literature were judged solely by its ability to elicit strong emotions,  Kirkus Reviews said about One True Thing, columnist-cum-novelist Quindlen would win another Pulitzer. And the same will be said about Black and Blue, a brilliant novel of suspense, substance, and importance.In Black and Blue, Fran Benedetto tells a spellbinding story: how at 19 she fell in love with Bobby Benedetto, how their passionate marriage became a nightmare, why she stayed, and what happened on the night she finally decided to run away with her 10-year-old son and start a new life under a new name. Living in fear in Florida--yet with increasing confidence, freedom, and hope--Fran unravels the complex threads of family, identity, and desire that shape a womans life, even as she begins to create a new one. As Fran starts to heal from the pain of the past, she almost believes she has escaped it--that Bobby Benedetto will not find her and again provoke the complex combustion between them of attraction and destruction, lust and love. Black and Blue is a beautifully written, heart-stopping story in which Anna Quindlen writes with power, wisdom, and humor about the real lives of men and women, the varieties of people and love, the bonds between mother and child, the solace of family and friendship, the inexplicable feelings between people who are passionately connected in ways they dont understand.",75,17,1999,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0440226104.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0804111359,Secret History,"Storytelling in the grand manner, The Secret History is a debut remarkable for its hypnotic erudition and acute psychological suspense, and for the richness of its emotions, ideas, and language. These are the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect hed long coveted - and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn. Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy, unwitting presence. But once taken into their confidence, he and the others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their secret and their future. Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable, this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon, of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally, it is a story of guilt and responsibility. An astonishing achievement by any standard, The Secret History immediately establishes Donna Tartt as a supremely gifted novelist.",20,24,1993,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0804111359.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0345391691,The Battle for God,"In our supposedly secular age governed by reason and technology, fundamentalism has emerged as an overwhelming force in every major world religion. Why? This is the fascinating, disturbing question that bestselling author Karen Armstrong addresses in her brilliant new book The Battle for God. Writing with the broad perspective and deep understanding of human spirituality that won huge audiences for A History of God, Armstrong illuminates the spread of militant piety as a phenomenon peculiar to our moment in history.Contrary to popular belief, fundamentalism is not a throwback to some ancient form of religion but rather a response to the spiritual crisis of the modern world. As Armstrong argues, the collapse of a piety rooted in myth and cult during the Renaissance forced people of faith to grasp for new ways of being religious--and fundamentalism was born. Armstrong focuses here on three fundamentalist movements: Protestant fundamentalism in America, Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, and Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt and Iran--exploring how each has developed its own unique way of combating the assaults of modernity.Blending history, sociology, and spirituality, The Battle for God is a compelling and compassionate study of a radical form of religious expression that is critically shaping the course of world history.",75,24,2001,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0345391691.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0375406328,Lying Awake,"In a Carmelite monastery outside present-day Los Angeles, life goes on in a manner virtually un-changed for centuries. Sister John of the Cross has spent years there in the service of God. And there, she alone experiences visions of such dazzling power and insight that she is looked upon as a spiritual master. But Sister Johns visions are accompanied by powerful headaches, and when a doctor reveals that they may be dangerous, she faces a devastating choice. For if her spiritual gifts are symptoms of illness rather than grace, will a cure mean the end of her visions and a soul once again dry and searching?This is the dilemma at the heart of Mark Salzmans spare, astonishing new novel. With extraordinary dexterity, the author of the best-selling Iron & Silk and The Soloist brings to life the mysterious world of the cloister, giving us a brilliantly realized portrait of women today drawn to the rigors of an ancient religious life, and of one womans trial at the perilous intersection of faith and reason. Lying Awake is a novel of remarkable empathy and imagination, and Mark Salzmans most provocative work to date.",20,28,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0375406328.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0375400117,Memoirs of a Geisha,"According to Arthur Goldens absorbing first novel, the word geisha does not mean prostitute, as Westerners ignorantly assume--it means artisan or artist. To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction, Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music, dance, clever conversation, crafty battle with rival beauties, and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons. After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia--and an M.A. in English--he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha. This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture, chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki, who spent years charming the very rich and famous. The result is a novel with the broad social canvas (and love of coincidence) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austens intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering. Readers experience the entire life of a geisha, from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her mizuage (virginity) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams. We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western trophy wife than to a prostitute--and, as in Austen, flat-out prostitution and early death is a womans alternative to the repressive, arcane system of courtship. In simple, elegant prose, Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism, a too-revealing (or not revealing enough) glimpse of flesh under the kimono, or a vicious rumor spread by a rival as cruel as a spider.  Goldens web is finely woven, but his book has a serious flaw: the geishas true romance rings hollow--the love of her life is a symbol, not a character. Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn, but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity--the plight all geisha share. Still, Golden has won the triple crown of fiction: he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid, now-vanished world, and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.",30,28,1997,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0375400117.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0679423079,Nicholas Nickleby (Everyman's Library),"Charles Dickens had an understanding of mid-Victorian society second to none, and genius and energy massive enough to make the absurdities and terrors of that society come alive on the page. Nicholas Nickleby, with its episodes of chicanery in finance and education, and the dramatic intensity with which it tells the story of its openhearted young protagonist and its frightening villain, the magnificently rendered Ralph Nickleby, represents Dickens at his clear-eyed, indignant, and mesmerizing best.             When Nicholas Nickleby is left penniless by the death of his father, he appeals to his Uncle Ralph to help him and his mother and sister. But Ralph conceives a violent hatred of the young man, and his schemes of persecution haunt Nicholas through a series of picaresque adventures, including a job as a tutor at a horrific school for unwanted boys run by the cruel Wackford Squeers and a stint as a member of the eccentric Crummles family theater troupe. Without shying away from the grimmer aspects of the world Nicholas encounters on his path to eventual happiness, the story remains one of Dickens’s most high-spirited and exuberant. This edition reprints the original Everyman preface by G. K. Chesterton and includes thirty-nine illustrations by Phiz.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)",80,28,1993,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0679423079.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0679450432,Dark Lady,"Dashiell Hammett, a master of big city crime fiction, would have enjoyed Richard North Pattersons latest thriller, set in a fictional Midwestern city called Steelton. This burnt-out burg is located on the shores of Lake Erie--and is a place bitterly divided by politics. The construction of a $275 million baseball stadium threatens to be Steeltons downfall rather than its redemption. Arthur Bright is the prosecutor of Erie County, but he wants to become mayor. His campaign attacks the new ballpark as a boondoggle, a shameful diversion of public financing from such pressing needs as better schools, better housing, and safer streets. His protégé, Assistant County Prosecutor Stella Marz is 38, ambitious, and has been dubbed the dark lady by various defense lawyers. If Arthur wins the mayoral race, she intends to become prosecutor herself. But two murders involving drugs and twisted sex threaten her future. First, Tommy Fielding, the project manager for Steelton 2000 (as the new home of the Steelton Blues will be called), is found dead in the company of a hooker--both apparently having overdosed on heroin. The fact that Fielding was gay and had never used drugs before bothers Stella and Chief Detective Nathaniel Dance. Their worries are soon pushed aside by another, more shocking murder--Jack Novak, a defense lawyer, is discovered hanging from his closet door, castrated and dressed in drag. Jack was once Stellas lover--and he was also one of Brights largest contributors. For Stella, the murders are too close to home. Maybe this is about me. But I have to see it through. Dark Lady is shrouded by the dark clouds of deceit and greed, and the sleek structure of Steelton 2000 dominates the landscape like a Dr. Frankensteins Castle with luxury boxes. --Dick Adler",30,28,1999,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0679450432.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

At its center is Lily Blake, a talented singer who shuns the limelight and cherishes her privacy. Tricked by a devious reporter into unwittingly giving an interview about her friendship with a distinguished churchman -- a newly appointed Cardinal -- she finds herself accused of having had an affair with him. Shocked and dismayed, Lily becomes a pariah and suffers the brutal, ultimate violation of her privacy as headlines all across the country proclaim her guilt. Hounded by the press, fired from her job, deprived of all public freedom, Lily has no choice but to flee. She returns in secret to her hometown of Lake Henry, in a remote, beautiful part of New Hampshire. But, idyllic as it may look, Lake Henry, too, has its secrets. Some were the cause of her leaving home in the first place, so returning to her birthplace and her family is not without its own stress and pain. Driven by the need to exact justice -- and, for herself, some kind of closure -- from the media that changed her life forever, Lily forms an uneasy alliance with John Kipling, a journalist who was born and raised in Lake Henrys poorest neighborhood. His successful career as a big-city reporter has ended disastrously, and John has come back home to edit the local newspaper, Lake News. At first he sees Lily as a victim, as well as a subject for the book he hopes to write. But soon she becomes someone whose appeal -- and cause -- he cannot deny, even at the risk of taking on his former colleagues in her defense. Set against the physical beauty of New Hampshire and against the complex web of family life and relationships in a small town, Lake News moves triumphantly toward a surprising and deeply satisfying conclusion. Barbara Delinskys bestselling Three Wishes was praised by Publishers Weekly for its spare, controlled, and poignant prose that evokes the simplicity and joys of small-town life.

Nicholas Spencer, charismatic head of the medical research company Gen-stone, involved in the development of an anticancer vaccine, suddenly disappears. His private plane crashes en route to Puerto Rico, but his body is not found.  Early results of the vaccine seemed highly promising. Yet, coinciding with Nicholas Spencers disappearance comes news that the FDA is denying approval. Then follows the shocking revelation that Spencer had looted Gen-stone of huge sums of money -- including the lifetime savings of people who had risked every penny they had.  Marcia Carley DeCarlo, the thirty-two-year-old columnist for the Wall Street Weekly, is assigned to cover the story. Carley is the stepsister of Spencers wife, Lynn, an aggressive PR woman and socialite, whom she dislikes and distrusts.  The day after news of her husbands disappearance rocks the financial and medical world, Lynn attends a meeting of the stockholders of Gen-stone, flaunting expensive clothing and jewelry. Accused of having participated in the scam, she appears indifferent to the anger and despair of the people attending, among them a man whose child has cancer and who is now about to lose his home. That night, she narrowly escapes death when her mansion in Bedford, New York, is set on fire.

Now, in the most complex and shocking book of her long career, she delves into the motivation that drove a seemingly successful man to kill, and she explores heretofore unknown aspects of a fatal affair between a beautiful young woman who moved confidently in the heady world of the upper echelons of government and a widely admired millionaire attorney who was an immensely popular political figure. On June 27, 1996, thirty-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, who was the scheduling secretary for the governor of Delaware, had dinner with a man she had been having a secret affair with for more than two years. Tommy Capano, forty-seven, was perhaps the most politically powerful man in Wilmington. Son of a wealthy contractor, former state prosecutor, partner in a prestigious law firm, advisor to governors and mayors, Tom Capano had a soft-spoken and considerate manner that endeared him to many. Although recently estranged from his wife, he was a devoted father to his four beautiful young daughters, the trusted son of his widowed mother, and the backbone of his extended family. But sometime after 9:15 that night when Anne Marie and Tom left a Philadelphia restaurant, something terrible happened to Anne Marie. It would be forty-eight hours before her brothers and sisters realized that she had disappeared entirely. Ann Rule brilliantly traces the lives of both Fahey and Capano as she discloses the intimate details of their ill-fated bonding. A vulnerable, trusting woman becomes spellbound by a charming, duplicitous married man, and what begins as a seemingly unremarkable affair is slowly transformed into an obsessive, convoluted, and deadly relationship. Through her impeccable research, Rule peels away layer after layer of deception to reveal a man who lived a secret life for decades, a man so greedy that he would sacrifice anyone to gain what he desired. One of his many mistresses—all of whom were unknown to one another—was Deborah MacIntyre, an attractive and wealthy member of one of Wilmingtons oldest families and an administrator of an elite private school. She, too, would become part of the mystery surrounding Anne Maries disappearance. As three prominent families are destroyed to satisfy one mans jealous obsessions, this unfathomable tragedy becomes a tale that few would believe if it were presented as fiction. Shockingly, it is all true. Destined to become a classic, And Never Let Her Go is a riveting account of forbidden love and murder among the rich and powerful, and a chilling insight into the evil that sometimes hides behind even the most charming façade.",50,35,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0671868713.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0060199563,Thief of Time,"It was only a matter of time before Terry Pratchett would win the minds and hearts of America. Already a worldwide sensation and Great Britains indisputable number one author, this intellectually audacious and effortlessly hilarious writer sold more hardcover books in the United Kingdom during the previous decade than any other living novelist. His novels have reigned supreme on English bestseller lists since before the Iron Lady left Downing Street, and though some things have changed since then, Pratchett, thankfully, continues to pen insightfully irreverent tales set in a world a lot like our own -- only different.Celebrated as one of the keenest practitioners of satire and parody at work today -- alongside Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen -- Terry Pratchett commands a loyal and ever-increasing number of readers and appreciative critics from coast to coast in our own country. As he skewers all aspects of modern life -- and especially our sacred cows -- Pratchett makes us laugh and challenges us to think. And hes at his sharpest, most uproarious best in Thief of Time.Everybody wants more time, which is why on Discworld its management is entrusted to the experts: the venerable Monks of History, who store it and pump it from where its wasted, like underwater (after all, how much time does a codfish really need?) to places like cities, where harried citizens are forever lamenting, Oh where does the time go?And while everyone always talks about slowing down, one clever soul is about to stop. Stop time, that is. For good. Going against everything known (and the nine tenths of everything that remains unknown), a young horologist has been commissioned to build the worlds first truly accurate clock. It falls to History Monk Lu-Tze and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd to find the timepiece and stop it before it starts. For if the Perfect Clock starts ticking, Time -- as we know it -- will stop. And then the trouble will really begin.A superb send-up of science and philosophy, religion and death (after all, isnt that where time stops, for most of us, anyway?), and a host of other timely topics, Thief of Time provides the perfect opportunity to kick back and unwind. So dont put off till tomorrow what you could do today. Read Thief of Time. Right this minute. Because tomorrow may not come. (Youll have to read the book to find out why. This is a Terry Pratchett novel, after all.)Tick ...",80,38,2001,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0060199563.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0060188731,Bel Canto,"An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here.In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry. Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months. With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects:  Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that Gods own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven.  Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, Bel Canto remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. --Victoria Jenkins",85,38,2001,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0060188731.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
006017143X,The Night Listener,"Armistead Maupin, one of Americas literary icons, returns after an absence of eight years with the tale of Gabriel Noone, a writer whose late-night radio stories have brought him into the home of millions. Noone is in the midst of a painful separation from his longtime lover when a publisher sends him proofs of a remarkable book: the memoir of an ailing thirteen-year-old boy who suffered horrific abuse at the hands of his parents. Now living with his adoptive mother, Pete Lomax is not only a brave and gifted diarist but also a devoted listener to Noones show. When Noone phones the boy to offer encouragement, it soon becomes clear that Pete sees in this heartsick middle-aged storyteller the loving father he has always wanted. Thus begins an extraordinary friendship that only grows deeper as the boys health deteriorates, freeing Noone to unlock his innermost feelings.Then, out of the blue, troubling questions arise, exploding Noones comfortable assumptions and causing his ordered existence to spin wildly out of control. As he walks a vertiginous line between truth and illusions, he is finally forced to confront all of his relationships--familial, romantic, and erotic.Few novelists in America write with such unerring insight and honesty in mapping the territory of the human heart. And in The Night Listener, Armistead Maupin has given us his most ambitious and daringly imaginative work. As complex and hypnotically engrossing as the best of mysteries, it will move and challenge his readers as never before. ",40,38,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/006017143X.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0451625889,The Prince,"For over four hundred years, The Prince has been the basic handbook of politics, statesmanship, and power. Written by a Florentine nobleman whose name has become a synonym for crafty plotting, it is a fascinating political and social document, as pertinent today as when it first appeared. Machiavelli wanted to set down for all time the rules and moves in the ageless game of politics, and, as the most successful statesman of his day, he devised this highly readable formula for the man who seeks power. There was little modern democracy in sixteenth century Italy, and as a result, Machiavellis work became thought of as a blueprint for dictators - instead of a guide for efficient democratic government.Witty, informative and devilishly shrewd, Machiavelli has long been required reading for everyone interested in politics and power. The Prince is one of the significant books of all time.CHRISTIAN GRAUSS, the late Dean Emeritus of Princeton University, has written a new and penetrating introduction to this MENTOR edition, explaining the times in which Machiavelli lived and the meaning of the book to todays reader.

The household staff dont know what shes talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the childrens uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid?

0060932759,Daughter of Fortune,"Oprah Book Club® Selection, February 2000: Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut, The House of the Spirits, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa. But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction, Daughter of Fortune, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep.  You have English blood, like us, Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language.  The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: You, English? Dont get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine. And certainly Elizas almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side.  As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremys firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chien, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for. Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chiens past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all in Daughter of Fortune. --Margaret Prior",85,54,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0060932759.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

It begins,  If you really want to hear about it, the first thing youll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I dont feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.

Alice Sebolds haunting and heartbreaking debut novel, The Lovely Bones, unfolds from heaven, where life is a perpetual yesterday and where Susie narrates and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends, as well as her brazen killer and the sad detective working on her case. As Sebold fashions it, everyone has his or her own version of heaven. Susies resembles the athletic fields and landscape of a suburban high school: a heaven of her simplest dreams, where there were no teachers.... We never had to go inside except for art class.... The boys did not pinch our backsides or tell us we smelled; our textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue.  The Lovely Bones works as an odd yet affecting coming-of-age story. Susie struggles to accept her death while still clinging to the lost world of the living, following her familys dramas over the years like an episode of My So-Called Afterlife. Her family disintegrates in their grief: her father becomes determined to find her killer, her mother withdraws, her little brother Buckley attempts to make sense of the new hole in his family, and her younger sister Lindsey moves through the milestone events of her teenage and young adult years with Susie riding spiritual shotgun. Random acts and missed opportunities run throughout the book--Susie recalls her sole kiss with a boy on Earth as like an accident--a beautiful gasoline rainbow. Though sentimental at times, The Lovely Bones is a moving exploration of loss and mourning that ultimately puts its faith in the living and that is made even more powerful by a cast of convincing characters. Sebold orchestrates a big finish, and though things tend to wrap up a little too well for everyone in the end, one can only imagine (or hope) that heaven is indeed a place filled with such happy endings. --Brad Thomas Parsons",75,59,2004,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0316168815.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Now the author of The Bridges of Madison County has written a new book that’s taut with suspense—blending love, danger, and adventure like nothing he’s ever written before.Novelist Danny Pastor liked what he found in lazily beautiful Puerto Vallarta, Mexico: Luz María, a woman he was crazy about; cantinas that played his kind of music; and la dolce vita, the sweet life. That was the problem. Danny needed to write, and he was up against a blank wall, not turning out a word while his money ran low and his nerves went wild.Then he was in the right place, or the wrong one, to be the sole witness when a shooter gunned down an American naval officer. At a café table with Luz, Danny Pastor saw it all, and saw the possibility of a story, a surefire, prizewinning account that could restore his pride and make him famous.

0446527165,Wish You Well,"
David Baldacci has made a name for himself crafting big, burly legal thrillers with larger-than-life plots. However, Wish You Well, set in his native Virginia, is a tale of hope and wonder and something of a miracle just itching to happen. This shift from contentious urbanites to homespun hill families may come as a surprise to some of Baldaccis fans--but they can rest assured: the authors sense of pacing and exuberant prose have made the leap as well.
The year is 1940. After a car accident kills 12-year-old Lous and 7-year-old Ozs father and leaves their mother Amanda in a catatonic trance, the children find themselves sent from New York City to their great-grandmother Louisas farm in Virginia. Louisas hardscrabble existence comes as a profound shock to precocious Lou and her shy brother. Still struggling to absorb their abandonment, they enter gamely into a life that tests them at every turn--and offers unimaginable rewards. For Lou, who dreams of following in her fathers literary footsteps, the misty, craggy Appalachians and the equally rugged individuals who make the mountains their home quickly become invested with an almost mythic significance:They took metal cups from nails on the wall and dipped them in the water, and then sat outside and drank. Louisa picked up the green leaves of a mountain spurge growing next to the springhouse, which revealed beautiful purple blossoms completely hidden underneath. One of Gods little secrets, she explained. Lou sat there, cup cradled between her dimpled knees, watching and listening to her great-grandmother in the pleasant shade...Baldacci switches deftly between lovingly detailed character description (an area in which his debt to Laura Ingalls Wilder and Harper Lee seems evident) and patient development of the novels central plot. If that plot is a trifle transparent--no one will be surprised by Amandas miraculous recovery or by the childrens eventual battle with the nefarious forces of industry in an attempt to save their great-grandmothers farm--neither reader nor character is the worse for it. After all, nostalgia is about remembering things one already knows. --Kelly Flynn",70,61,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0446527165.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn’t so bad—at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isnt long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de Bernières is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuels Nether Parts, Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island—the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins—would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Bernières seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.",35,63,1995,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/067976397X.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0786863986,A Monk Swimming,"Slapped with a libel suit after an appearance on a talk show, Malachy McCourt crows, If they could only see me now in the slums of Limerick, a big shot, sued for a million. Bejesus, isnt America a great and wonderful country? His older brother Franks Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, Angelas Ashes, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachys boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land. He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint on The Tonight Show hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie. Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life.",50,64,1998,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0786863986.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0684717255,I And Thou,"An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here.Martin Bubers I and Thou has long been acclaimed as a classic. Many prominent writers have acknowledged its influence on their work; students of intellectual history consider it a landmark; and the generation born after World War II considers Buber one of its prophets. Bubers main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways: (1) that of the I toward an It, toward an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience; (2) that of the I toward Thou, in which we move into existence in a relationship without bounds. One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. All of our relationships, Buber contends, bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.The need for a new English translation had been felt for many years. The old version was marred by many inaccuracies and misunderstandings, and its recurrent use of the archaic thou was seriously misleading. Professor Walter Kaufmann, a distinguished writer and philosopher in his own right who was close to Buber, retranslated the work at the request of Bubers family. He added a wealth of informative footnotes to clarify obscurities and bring the reader closer to the original and wrote an extensive prologue that opened up new perspectives on the book and on Bubers thought. This volume provided a new basis for all subsequent discussions of Buber.",25,71,1971,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0684717255.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Eat a meal, fold laundry, talk on the phone--or refresh your spirit. Just 20 minutes a day is all it takes to retreat in tranquility and reconnect with your soul, according to Dr. Rachel Harris, a practicing psychotherapist and associate of Big Surs (often celebrity-studded) Esalen Institute. In our fast-paced lives, we desperately need retreats to regain our perspective, help us balance our inner and outer lives--a retreat gives us a chance to just say no to incessant stress and time pressure.... she writes. Incorporating into her book the wisdom of multiple world religions and spiritual masters from Buddhism to Jung, Harris offers a variety of flexible approaches to finding that quiet place. She provides practical advice about finding the right retreat setting, as well as the appropriate tools to enhance the experience. Organized around 12 universal themes--faith, forgiveness, gratitude, healing, intuition, joy, love, patience, peace, relaxation, self-acceptance, and self-care--each chapter provides step-by-step instructions on structuring a self-led retreat to fit ones personal needs. Because a retreat can be anything that allows us to intentionally enter another world, Harris advocates such varied practices as expressive drawing, journal writing, and dance as well as centered prayer, ritual magic, and music. Liberally scattered throughout the guide are personal observations and intriguing case histories drawn from Harriss 30 years as a practicing psychoanalyst. Recognizing that setting aside even a small amount of time each day can be a challenge, Harris also includes suggestions on how to retreat for just one to five minutes at a time. Whats a one-minute retreat like? Look at babies, she suggests--gazing into ones eyes will make you feel instantly joyful. -­Marianne Painter",75,74,2001,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0330484516.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Años después de su publicación, el filósofo danés anotaba en su diario: «Cuando yo haya muerto bastará mi libro “Temor y Temblor” para convertirme en un escritor inmortal. Se leerá, se traducirá a otras lenguas, y el espantoso pathos que contiene esa obra hará temblar. En la época en que fue escrita, cuando su autor se escondía tras la apariencia de un flâneur, nadie podía sospechar la seriedad que encerraba este libro.

For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur—offstage. Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt’s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she’s outgrown her siblings—Luke, Matt, and Bo—who were once her entire world. In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one’s expectations right to the very end. Tragic, funny, unforgettable, this deceptively simple masterpiece about the perils of hero worship leapt to the top of the bestseller lists only days after being released in Canada and earned glowing reviews in The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, to name a few.",70,82,2003,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0385337639.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

0486272745,The Prince (Dover Thrift Editions),"As a young Florentine envoy to the courts of France and the Italian principalities, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) was able to observe firsthand the lives of people strongly united under one powerful ruler. His fascination with that political rarity and his intense desire to see the Medici family assume a similar role in Italy provided the foundation for his primer for princes. In this classic guide to acquiring and maintaining political power, Machiavelli used a rational approach to advise prospective rulers, developing logical arguments and alternatives for a number of potential problems, among them governing hereditary monarchies, dealing with colonies and the treatment of conquered peoples.Refreshing in its directness, yet often disturbing in its cold practicality, The Prince sets down a frighteningly pragmatic formula for political fortune. Starkly relevant to the political upheavals of the 20th century, this calculating prescription for power remains today, nearly 500 years after it was written, a timely and startling lesson in the practice of autocratic rule that continues to be much read and studied by students, scholars and general readers as well.Reprint of The Prince from Vol. 36 of the Harvard Classics series, translated by N.

3150000335,Kabale Und Liebe,"ISBNs moved from  this editionDas 1784 erschienene und uraufgeführte Drama Kabale und Liebe (ursprünglich unter dem Titel Luise Millerin geplant) von Friedrich Schiller beschließt, in Anlehnung an Gotthold Ephraim Lessings Emilia Galotti, die Entwicklung des bürgerlichen Trauerspiels im 18. Jahrhundert - eine literarische Form, die mit der klassizistischen Auffassung und Tragödie bricht und Probleme des häuslich-privaten Bereichs und den Konflikt der Stände zum Gegenstand der tragischen Handlung macht. In sehr direkter Weise wird in Schillers Kabale und Liebe mit seinem auf Spannung angelegten klaren Aufbau Kritik an den politischen Zuständen in der Fürstentümern geübt: Willkür, Mätressenwirtschaft, Verkauf von Landeskindern. Das bürgerliche Trauerspiel kontrastiert die verrottete Moral des Hofes mit der Tugend des Bürgertums. Im Mittelpunkt des Sturm-und-Drang-Stücks steht die tragische Liebesbeziehung zwischen Angehörigen verschiedener Stände: zwischen dem Adligen Ferdinand und der Musikertochter Luise Miller. Kabale und Liebe eroberte rasch die Bühne und gehört zu den großen Klassikern des deutschen Dramas.",70,97,1989,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/3150000335.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

3492045642,QuerschÃ?Â¼sse - Downsize This!,"Nach dem sensationellen Erfolg von Stupid White Men hat sich der Piper Verlag beeilt, Michael Moores Erstling jetzt auf den deutschen Markt zu werfen. Zur Vorgeschichte: 1989 bereits hatte der bullige Sozialarbeiter mit seiner Filmdoku Roger & Me, einer Art Fingerübung für seine aufrüttelnde Doku Bowling for Columbine, Furore gemacht. Darin ging es darum, dem Chairman von General Motors den sozialen Kahlschlag in Moores Heimatstadt Flint in Michigan vor Augen zu führen. GM hatte dort trotz Rekordgewinn 30.000 Arbeitsplätze gestrichen. Moores erster Einsatz! Seine Wut über diese Art Gesundschrumpfung, ihre Opfer und Profiteure, gab den Ausschlag zu diesem Buch. Das verhasste Großkonzern-Unwort wird zur Wurzel allen Übels erklärt. Moore arbeitet mit unglaublichen Zahlen und Insiderinfos -- versteigt sich jedoch am Beispiel des Oklahoma-City-Bombers Timothy McVeigh zu einer düsteren Polemik über die wahren Terroristen im Lande. Moore als dröge argumentierender Entrechteten-Anwalt hätte nicht den immensen Erfolg, wäre in seinem Herzen nicht Platz für ätzende Realsatire. Den Sammelbildern mit kriminellen Konzernchefs folgt ein resignierender Blick auf Republikaner und Demokraten, die er in ihrer Programmatik giftig mit einem Restaurant vergleicht, das lediglich Hüttenkäse und Knabberstangen auf der Karte führt. Auch seinen Lieblingsfeind, den erzkonservativen Pat Buchanan, outet er gnadenlos, indem er ihm diverse Wahlkampf-Spenden unter dem Tarnmantel von Teufelsanbeter- und Pädophilen-Organisationen andient -- die dieser auch prompt annahm. Moore pur! Dem Jubel über den Sieg der Demokraten 1992 und Clintons angekündigte Gesundheitsreform folgt die ernüchternde Erkenntnis, dass der Präsident am Ende der 100 Tage immer noch der einzige Amerikaner war, der kostenlos einen Arzt besuchen konnte. Hillary Clinton hingegen inspiriert ihn zu einer Liebeserklärung, die zu einem regelrechten feministischen Manifest ausartet. Der Kampfhund Moore zeigt sich in einer glühenden Verteidigungsrede im Prozess gegen O.J.

3492207006,Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit.,"Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit ist auf den ersten Blick zugleich ein Seefahrerroman, ein Roman über das Abenteuer und die Sehnsucht danach und ein Entwicklungsroman. Doch hat Sten Nadolny die Biographie des englischen Seefahrers und Nordpolforschers John Franklin (1786-1847) zu einer subtilen Studie über die Zeit umgeschrieben: die Langsamkeit als eine Kunst, dem Rhythmus des Lebens Sinn zu verleihen. Wie bei einem Palimpsest erscheint hinter den Sätzen eine andere Schrift, hinter der Prägnanz und Redlichkeit der Aufklärung verbergen sich Humor und Traurigkeit der Romantik.Von Kindheit an träumt John Franklin davon, zur See zu fahren, obwohl er dafür denkbar ungeeignet ist: Langsam im Sprechen und Denken, langsam in seinen Reaktionen mißt er die Zeit nach eigenen Maßstäben. Zunächst erkennt nur sein Lehrer, daß Johns eigenartige Behinderung auch Vorzüge hat - was er einmal erfaßt hat, das behält er, das Einzigartige, das Detail begreift er besser als andere. John Franklin geht zur Marine, erlebt den Krieg und das Sterben. Beides trifft ihn um so furchtbarer, als er innerhalb des von ihm kaum begriffenen, chaotisch schnellen Geschehens einzelne Vorgänge wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sieht. Er träumt von friedlicher Entdeckung, will die legendäre Nordwestpassage finden.",55,106,1987,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/3492207006.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
3498020862,Die Korrekturen.,"Die Korrekturen beginnt mit dem Einzug einer Kältefront aus der Prärie: Es war deutlich zu spüren: Etwas Furchtbares würde geschehen. Die Sonne tief am Himmel, ein winziges Licht, ein erkaltender Stern. Windstoß auf Windstoß der Unordnung. Die Bäume rastlos, die Temperaturen fallend, die ganze nördliche Religion der Dinge: aufs Ende gerichtet.Ebenso stürmisch wie sein Anfang wurde Jonathan Franzens Roman in den USA gefeiert. Kritiker überschlugen sich mit enthusiastischen Besprechungen; das Buch wurde mit dem National Book Award ausgezeichnet und die Tatsache, dass Franzen sich weigerte, in der Talkshow von Oprah Winfrey aufzutreten, sorgte zusätzlich für Gesprächsstoff. Seit Don DeLillos Unterwelt hat es in den USA nicht mehr so eine Aufregung um einen Roman gegeben. Auch hier zu Lande hat der Roman bereits vor seiner Übersetzung ins Deutsche viel Aufmerksamkeit erweckt. Noch nie ist das Buch eines zuvor vollkommen unbekannten amerikanischen Autors in Deutschland so begierig erwartet worden, urteilte die Süddeutsche Zeitung. Franzen erzählt die Geschichte der Familie Lambert aus dem Mittleren Westen. Im Zentrum steht die Frage, ob es Enid Lambert gelingt, ihre drei erwachsenen Kinder für ein letztes Weihnachten zurück nach St. Jude zu locken. Kapitel für Kapitel lernt der Leser das Leben und vor allem die Krisen der Eltern Enid und Alfred und ihrer drei Kinder Chip, Gary und Denise kennen. Alfred, pensionierter Ingenieur, leidet an Parkinson, seine Frau Enid unter ihrem Ordnungs - und Sparwahn, aber vor allem unter ihrem Mann. Der älteste Sohn Gary, erfolgreicher Banker in Philadelphia, steckt in einer Ehekrise und leugnet mit aller Macht seine Depressionen. Chip muss wegen einer Affäre mit einer Studentin seine Stelle als Literaturdozent aufgeben. Nachdem auch sein Versuch als Drehbuchautor gescheitert ist, findet er sich in Litauen wieder, wo er in einen groß angelegten Internet-Betrug verwickelt wird. Und Denise, die jüngste Tochter, verliert ihren Job als erfolgreiche Gourmet-Köchin, weil sie sich auf eine Affäre sowohl mit ihrem Chef als auch mit dessen Frau einlässt.Es ist offensichtlich: Jeder der Lamberts ist auf seine Weise gescheitert. Dabei ist die junge Generation von ihrem Bemühen geprägt, die Lebensmodelle ihrer Eltern zu korrigieren. Oder wie Gary es formuliert: Sein ganzes Leben war so angelegt, dass es das Leben seines Vaters korrigierte - was ihm natürlich nicht gelingt. Am Ende steht doch nur die Wiederholung: die Familie als Schicksal.Der Roman bewegt sich mit enormer Leichtigkeit durch die vielschichtigen Beziehungs- und Gefühlsgeflechte der Lamberts. Ihre Sorgen, Hoffnungen, Ängste und Neurosen sind sehr menschlich dargestellt, komisch und tief traurig zugleich. Teilweise gelingen Franzen dramatische Vignetten mit Sitcom-artiger Absurdität. Schnelle Dialoge und Wechsel der Perspektive erzeugen eine szenische Dynamik, die den Leser im Strom der Erzählung mitreißt. Viele dieser Szenen haben hohen Wiedererkennungswert. Unweigerlich werden sich manchen Lesern Parallelen zur eigenen Familie aufdrängen.Aber Franzen hat mehr als die Geschichte einer Familie geschrieben. Indem er das persönliche Drama mit globalen Ereignissen verknüpft, ist ihm ein großer Gesellschaftsroman gelungen, der seine Leser so schnell nicht mehr loslässt. Großartige, intelligente Erzählliteratur! --Alexandra Plath",55,107,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/3498020862.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

3499151502,"Hebt den Dachbalken hoch, Zimmerleute / Seymour wird vorgestellt.","This book contains two separate stories: Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters is the first, and Seymour: An Introduction is the second.Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters is a story about the Glass family, narrated by Buddy, the second oldest brother. Buddy is attending his brother Seymours wedding to a gal named Muriel, but hes on Army leave during active duty in World War II. At the wedding, everyone is stunned when Seymour does not show up.The action of the story picks up when several characters end up carpooling together following the failed wedding. The others (the Matron of Honor and her husband, and a couple of stragglers) are talking about Seymour and the disappointment of his not showing up, and Buddy never tells them that he is secretly Seymours brother, so they talk more openly with him than they otherwise would.They criticize Seymour and speculate about his character flaws and deficiencies, but Buddy finds their assessments quite judgmental and biased. He then decides to tell the car who he really is, shaming them for their loose criticisms.He finds Seymours journal, and he discovers a strange message from their sister Boo Boo for Seymour on their bathroom mirror: Raise high the roof beam, carpenters. Like Ares comes the bridegroom/ taller far than a tall man. This is a fragment from the Greek poet Sappho.Seymour: An Introduction is a kind of elegy for Seymour from Buddy, told in the form of an introduction to the reader. The reader makes Seymours acquaintance while knowing that Seymour technically isnt alive when the story is published, having killed himself in 1948.This portion of the story is told in stream of consciousness, and it discusses Eastern religious mysticism.",70,108,1998,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/3499151502.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. Routine, order and predictability shelter him from the messy, wider world. Then, at fifteen, Christophers carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbors dog, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer and turns to his favorite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents marriage. As he tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, we are drawn into the workings of Christophers mind. And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddons choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotion. The effect is dazzling, making for a novel that is deeply funny, poignant, and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing is a mind that perceives the world literally.

For beautiful, aspiring attorney Christina Carrera, the case leads to a dangerous liaison with Dooher, who has wanted more than anything to have this woman by his side and in his bed.

Planning a move to Canada, his father packs up the family and their menagerie and they hitch a ride on an enormous freighter.

In the course of Brady Udall’s high-spirited, inexhaustibly inventive novel, Edgar survives not just this bizarre accident, but a hellish boarding school for Native American orphans, a well-meaning but wildly dysfunctional Mormon foster-family, and the loss of most of the illusions that are supposed to make life bearable. What persists is Edgar’s innate goodness, his belief in the redeeming power of language, and his determination to find and forgive the man who almost killed him.

0679725393,The House of Mirth (Library of America),"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth, warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldnt and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Whartons charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age.  One of Whartons earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room. Indeed, herein lies Lilys problem. She has, were told, been brought up to be ornamental, and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By todays standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of good marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, poor, miserable, marriageable girls. Lilys rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliners assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward, she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, its hard not to agree with Lilys own assessment of herself: I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else. Nevertheless, its even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why The House of Mirth remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. --Melanie Rehak",70,125,1990,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780679725398-us.jpg

0060173289,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood : A Novel,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewA powerfully literate yet thoroughly engaging and accessible novel, this story of a close-knit society of southern women has become a modern cult classic bolstered by author Rebecca Wellss abiltity to transcend standard-issue chick lit with bold and unique characters and a tale that digs deeply into the complex bonds of family.The entangled story of actress Siddalee Walker, her mother Vivi, and Vivis group of pals -- the Ya-Yas -- gets off to a heated start when Siddas disparaging remarks about her mother run in the New York Times. Vivi declares all-out war and immediately cuts Sidda out of her will, pushes a libel suit, and forbids the other septuagenarian Ya-Yas to speak to Sidda ever again. Convinced she doesnt know how to love, a shaken Sidda postpones her upcoming wedding and flees to a remote Washington cabin. Suddenly concerned about her daughter, Vivi convenes an emergency Ya-Ya council and at last decides to reveal her jealously guarded past to Sidda through her treasured scrapbook, The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.The scrapbook spans Ya-Ya history, documenting among other things the hilarious Shirley Temple Look-Alike Contest that first united the four women in a conspiracy against polite society; the secret history and initiation rites of the group; a trip to Atlanta to attend the premier of Gone With The Wind; and Vivis first and greatest love. It also sheds light on Vivis reaction to the constraints of motherhood and the alcoholism, self-medication, and spiritual confusion that eventually led to a complete nervous breakdown. Also buried in the book is the key that unlocks Siddas childhood memory of a lost lesson of love and brings her to a new understanding of her familys shared triumphs and tragedies.Much more universal in its appeal than the womens book some reviewers have been tempted to call it (according to Wells, Its a book for women -- and smart men), The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood manages with passion, humor, and an irrepressible gift for language to somehow show readers of all backgrounds a mirror-perfect reflection of their own life experiences.

0679450440,Protect and Defend,"A compelling new novel from Richard North Patterson - a major departure and one that confirms his place among the most important popular novelists at work today.A newly elected president faces the unexpected chance to nominate a new chief justice of the Supreme Court.   His first choice is a nationally respected Court of Appeals judge, a woman whose nomination faces two serious obstacles: a long-held personal secret; and the prospect that a volatile abortion case- a trial pitting a 15-year-old girl against her pro-life parents - will come before the court.  And the Senate majority leader is determined to thwart the presidents nomination for reasons that cross the boundary between the political and the personal.As these stories intertwine, building in complexity and suspense, Patterson gives us the resounding clash of competing ambitions between the president and the majority leader; the equally momentous collision of science and culture in the courtroom; and, in an unprecedented novelistic depiction of the legal process from the perspective of the judge rather than the lawyers, a revelation of both how the judicial system works and how it intersects with politics, for better or for worse.PROTECT AND DEFEND is a triumph- the definitive novel of politics and law at the dawn of the 21st century.From the Hardcover edition.",35,138,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0679450440.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0394551427,Shoah,"A nine-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Nazi extermination camps, Shoah (the Hebrew word for Holocaust) was internationally hailed as a masterpiece upon its release in 1985. Shunning any re-creation, archival footage, or visual documentation of the events, filmmaker Claude Lanzmann relied on the words of witnesses—Jewish, Polish, and German—to describe in ruthless detail the bureaucratic machinery of the Final Solution, so that the remote experiences of the Holocaust became fresh and immediate. This book presents in an accessible and vivid format the testimony of survivors, participants, witnesses, and scholars. This tenth anniversary edition, published on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps, is newly revised and corrected in order to more accurately present the actual testimony of those interviewed. Shoah is an unparalleled oral history of the Holocaust, an intensely readable journey through the twentieth centurys greatest horror.",25,138,1985,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780394551425-us.jpg

0684833395,Catch 22,"Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

0743229878,Mount Vernon Love Story : A Novel of George and Martha Washington,"Mary Higgins Clarks interest in George Washington was first sparked by a radio series she was writing in the 1960s, called Portrait of a Patriot, vignettes of American presidents.Always a lover of history, she wrote this biographical novel - her first book - and titled it Aspire to the Heavens, which was the family motto of George Washingtons mother. With all events, dates, scenes and characters based on historical research, the book was published in 1969.Its recent discovery by a Washington family descendant led to its reissue under its new title, Mount Vernon Love Story.In researching George Washingtons life, Mary Higgins Clark was surprised to find the engaging man behind the pious legend. He was a giant of a man in every way, starting with his physical height. In an era where men averaged five foot seven inches, he towered over everyone at six foot three. He was the best dancer in the colony of Virginia. He was also a master horseman, which was why the Indians gave him their highest compliment: He rides his horse like an Indian.She dispels the widespread belief that although George Washington married an older woman, a widow, his true love was Sally Carey Fairfax, his best friends wife. Martha Dandridge Custis was older, but only by three months - she was twenty-seven to his twenty-six when they met. Mary Higgins Clark describes their relationship from their first meeting, their closeness and his tenderness toward her two children. Martha shared his life in every way, crossing the British lines to join him in Boston and enduing with him the bitter hardship of the winter in Valley Forge. As Lady Bird Johnson was never called Claudia, Martha Washington was never known as Martha. Her family and friends called her Patsy. George always called her my dearest Patsy and wore a locket with her picture around his neck.In Mount Vernon Love Story, Mary Higgins Clark tells the story of a rare marriage and brings to life the human side of the man who became the father of our country.",60,144,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0743229878.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0743206053,Kitchen Privileges : A Memoir,"In her long-awaited memoir, Mary Higgins Clark, Americas beloved and bestselling Queen of Suspense, recounts the early experiences that shaped her as a person and influenced her as a writer.Even as a young girl, growing up in the Bronx, Mary Higgins Clark knew she wanted to be a writer. The gift of storytelling was a part of her Irish ancestry, so it followed naturally that she would later use her sharp eye, keen intelligence, and inquisitive nature to create stories about the people and things she observed.Along with all Americans, those who lived in New York Citys borough of the Bronx suffered during the Depression. So it followed that when Marys father died, her mother, deciding to open the family home to boarders, placed a discreet sign next to the front door that read, FURNISHED ROOMS. KITCHEN PRIVILEGES. Very shortly the first in a succession of tenants arrived: a couple dodging bankruptcy who moved in with their wild-eyed boxer; a teacher who wept endlessly over her lost love; a deadbeat who tripped over a lamp while trying to sneak out in the middle of the night...The familys struggle to make ends meet; her days as a scholarship student in an exclusive girls academy; her after-school employment as a hotel switchboard operator (happily listening in on the guests conversations); the death of her beloved older brother in World War II; her brief career as a flight attendant for Pan Am (a job taken after a friend who flew with the airline said ever so casually, God, it was beastly hot in Calcutta); her marriage to Warren Clark, on whom shed had a crush for many years; sitting at the kitchen table, writing stories, and finally selling the first one for one hundreddollars (after six years and some forty rejections!) -- all these experiences figure into Kitchen Privileges, as does her husbands untimely death, which left her a widowed mother of five young children.Determined to care for her family and to make a career for herself, she went to work writing scripts for a radio show, but in her spare time she began writing novels. Her first, a biographical novel about the life of George Washington titled Aspire to the Heavens, found a publisher but disappeared without a trace when the publisher folded. (Recently it was rediscovered by a descendant of the Washington family and was reissued under the title Mount Vernon Love Story.) The experience, however, gave her the background and the preparation for writing Where Are the Children? which went on to become an international bestseller. That novel launched her career and was the first of twenty-seven (and still counting!) bestselling books of suspense.As Mary Higgins Clark has said when asked if she might consider giving up writing for a life of leisure, Never! To be happy for a year, win the lottery. To be happy for life, love what you do.In Kitchen Privileges, she reflects on the joy that her life as a writer has brought her, and shares with readers the love that she has found.",65,144,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0743206053.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0743206045,Daddy's Little Girl,"From Mary Higgins Clark, Americas best-selling Queen of Suspense, comes a dark and chilling story of murder, and its effects years later on the man convicted of the crime and the woman who helped convict him. It is a novel that takes the reader to the heights of suspense while exploring the depths of the criminal mind. * Ellie Cavanaugh was only seven years old when her fifteen-year-old sister, Andrea, was murdered near their home in Oldham-on-the-Hudson, a rural village in New Yorks Westchester County. There were three suspects: Rob Westerfield, nineteen-year-old scion of a wealthy, prominent family, whom Andrea has been secretly dating; Paul Stroebel, a sixteen-year-old schoolmate, who had a crush on Andrea; and Will Nebels, a local handyman in his forties. It was Ellie who had led her parents to a hideout in which Andreas body was found -- a secret hideaway in which she met her friends. And it was Ellie who was blamed by her parents for her sisters death for not telling them about this place the night Andrea was missing. It was also Ellies testimony that led to the conviction of the man she was firmly convinced was the killer. Steadfastly denying his guilt, he spent the next twenty-two years in prison. When he comes up for parole, Ellie, now an investigative reporter for an Atlanta newspaper, protests his release. Nonetheless, the convicted killer is set free and returns to Oldham. Determined to thwart his attempts to whitewash his reputation, Ellie also returns to Oldham, intent on creating a Website and writing a book that will conclusively prove his guilt. As she delves deeper into her research, however, she uncovers horrifying and heretofore unknownfacts that shed new light on her sisters murder. With each discovery, she comes closer to a confrontation with a desperate killer. Gripping and relentlessly compelling, Daddys Little Girl, a portrayal of a family shattered by crime, reflects Mary Higgins Clarks uncanny insight into the twisted mind of a killer and is further evidence of why she is Americas favorite author of suspense.",80,144,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0743206045.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

At its center is Lily Blake, a talented singer who shuns the limelight and cherishes her privacy. Tricked by a devious reporter into unwittingly giving an interview about her friendship with a distinguished churchman -- a newly appointed Cardinal -- she finds herself accused of having had an affair with him.Shocked and dismayed, Lily becomes a pariah and suffers the brutal, ultimate violation of her privacy as headlines all across the country proclaim her guilt. Hounded by the press, fired from her job, deprived of all public freedom, Lily has no choice but to flee. She returns in secret to her hometown of Lake Henry, in a remote, beautiful part of New Hampshire.But, idyllic as it may look, Lake Henry, too, has its secrets. Some were the cause of her leaving home in the first place, so returning to her birthplace and her family is not without its own stress and pain.Driven by the need to exact justice -- and, for herself, some kind of closure -- from the media that changed her life forever, Lily forms an uneasy alliance with John Kipling, a journalist who was born and raised in Lake Henrys poorest neighborhood. His successful career as a big-city reporter has ended disastrously, and John has come back home to edit the local newspaper, Lake News. At first he sees Lily as a victim, as well as a subject for the book he hopes to write. But soon she becomes someone whose appeal -- and cause -- he cannot deny, even at the risk of taking on his former colleagues in her defense.Set against thephysical beauty of New Hampshire and against the complex web of family life and relationships in a small town, Lake News moves triumphantly toward a surprising and deeply satisfying conclusion.Barbara Delinskys bestselling Three Wishes was praised by Publishers Weekly for its spare, controlled, and poignant prose that evokes the simplicity and joys of small-town life. Those same qualities are abundant in Lake News, which offers an intimate look at the complex relationship between an enigmatic man and a vulnerable, besieged woman, both struggling to find a new sense of community in a strange place they once called home.",60,144,1999,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0684864320.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Big trouble.A decade ago, The Bonfire of the Vanities defined an era--and established Tom Wolfe as our prime fictional chronicler of America at its most outrageous and alive. This time the setting is Atlanta, Georgia--a racially mixed late-century boomtown full of fresh wealth, avid speculators, and worldly-wise politicians. The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta real-estate entrepreneur turned conglomerate king, whose expansionist ambitions and outsize ego have at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 28,000-acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife--and a half-empty office tower with a staggering load of debt. When star running back Fareek Fanon--the pride of one of Atlantas grimmest slums--is accused of raping an Atlanta bluebloods daughter, the citys delicate racial balance is shattered overnight. Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real-estate syndicates, cast-off first wives of the corporate elite, the racially charged politics of college sports--Wolfe shows us the disparate worlds of contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most phenomenal, most admired contemporary novelist.",50,151,1998,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0374270325.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

044023722X,A Painted House,"The hill people and the Mexicans arrived on the same day. It was a Wednesday, early in September 1952. The Cardinals were five games behind the Dodgers with three weeks to go, and the season looked hopeless. The cotton, however, was waist-high to my father, over my head, and he and my grandfather could be heard before supper whispering words that were seldom heard. It could be a good crop.Thus begins the new novel from John Grisham, a story inspired by his own childhood in rural Arkansas. The narrator is a farm boy named Luke Chandler, age seven, who lives in the cotton fields with his parents and grandparents in a little house thats never been painted. The Chandlers farm eighty acres that they rent, not own, and when the cotton is ready they hire a truckload of Mexicans and a family from the Ozarks to help harvest it.For six weeks they pick cotton, battling the heat, the rain, the fatigue, and sometimes each other. As the weeks pass Luke sees and hears things no seven-year-old could possibly be prepared for, and he finds himself keeping secrets that not only threaten the crop but will change the lives of the Chandlers forever. ©2000, 2001 Belfry Holdings, Inc.

The Kiss is at once a moving testament to the fragility of life and a breathtaking story about the power of love to heal, to free, to transform, and to make broken spirits whole. On a warm June evening, a red double-decker bus, full of passengers, speeds down a London street. A few blocks away, a man and a woman climb into a limousine, reveling in a magical evening of dancing and champagne.  As their driver pulls into an intersection, the couple shares their first, searching kiss. For a moment, etched in time, all stands still — until, in a flash of metal and glass, their limousine is struck at full speed, crushed under the bus’s tremendous weight. And a long journey begins — toward healing, toward hope, toward dreams of an infinite future.... Isabelle Forrester is the wife of a prominent Parisian banker who has long since shut her out of his heart. For lonely years, Isabelle has lived a life of isolation, pouring her passions into caring for her desperately ill son, Teddy, and into making their Paris home as happy as possible for her teenage daughter, Sophie.  Isabelle allows herself one secret pleasure: a long-distance friendship by telephone with an American man, a Washington power broker who travels in the highest circles of politics and who, like Isabelle, is trapped in an empty marriage.  To Bill Robinson, Isabelle is a godsend, a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellectual curiosity — a kindred spirit who touches him across the miles with her warmth and gentle empathy. Their relationship is a gift, a lifeline that sustains them both through the heartache of marriages they cannot leave and will not betray.  Agreeing to meet for a few precious, innocent days in London, Isabelle and Bill find their friendship changing. Then, amid the sudden crash of steel against steel, they are thrust onto a new path, a path fraught with pain but also with possibility. Now, inside the cool, sterile wards of a London hospital, Isabelle and Bill cling to life, their bodies shattered almost beyond repair. In the days and weeks that follow, they slowly, painfully traverse a road to recovery littered with challenges of the body, spirit, and heart.  Together, they must find the strength not only to embrace life again but to face what they have left behind. For Isabelle, a loveless marriage turns into a brutal power struggle. For Bill, a time of healing exposes wounds that cut deeper than steel and realities that will test him to his core. For both, a tangle of changing relationships and the tragedy of another loss conspire to separate them once again. And this time they could lose each other forever.  In a novel that is as compelling as it is compassionate, Danielle Steel weaves a story of courage in the face of unimaginable loss.

0385503857,Oryx and Crake,"A stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The Blind Assassin, winner of the Booker Prize Margaret Atwoods new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwoods riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crakes high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers.",35,214,2003,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0385503857.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6-$7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity--a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival.

0385495145,The Messenger,"From the bestselling author of Joshua and A Portrait of Jesus comes a moving, eye-opening parable about a messenger sent to reawaken faith, love, and compassion in a world that has strayed from the lessons of the Gospels. In this Image paperback original, Joseph Girzone once again weaves a story that will transform readers understanding of Jesus teaching and change the way they put that teaching into action in their own lives. The Messenger is the story of the Kingdom of Light created by God on Earth. This kingdom started as a small community and grew to encompass vast numbers of people of every race and nation, transcending the boundaries of all worldly realms. But with the passage of time, the message of peace and forgiveness, love and joy, preserved in the book, is forgotten, overwhelmed by the selfish interests of its leaders. Watching over his people, God resolves to send a special messenger to renew the spirit of compassion and freedom among the rulers of the world. Francis, who became attached to God as a young boy and never lost the beauty and joy of that friendship, is entrusted with the precious mission. As Francis travels throughout the United States, Girzone brings to life the conflicts, hostility, and pain of our times and points the way toward peace and understanding. With humility and a strong sense of purpose, Francis teaches leaders to break through the crushing letter of the law and restore its spirit, to reunite groups torn apart by prejudice and hatred through love, and to show compassion to the less fortunate by welcoming them back home to the kingdom. Under the guidance of a new ruler well versed in the book, fear and skepticism give way to the sharing of ideas and the bringing together of people of different beliefs. And the miracle that begins in one part of the world soon spreads, touching the hearts and of transfiguring the lives of the people across the globe.",75,217,2002,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0385495145.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Never had any country sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. At the center of this unprecedented attempt at healing a nation has been Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom President Nelson Mandela named as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. With the final report of the Commission just published, Archbishop Tutu offers his reflections on the profound wisdom he has gained by helping usher South Africa through this painful experience.In No Future Without Forgiveness, Tutu argues that true reconciliation cannot be achieved by denying the past.  But nor is it easy to reconcile when a nation looks the beast in the eye. Rather than repeat platitudes about forgiveness, he presents a bold spirituality that recognizes the horrors people can inflict upon one another, and yet retains a sense of idealism about reconciliation. With a clarity of pitch born out of decades of experience, Tutu shows readers how to move forward with honesty and compassion to build a newer and more humane world.",30,217,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0385496907.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Through his eyes and the stories of those who surround him — his uncle Isadore, Dickensian and overbearing; Pam, a quietly wise girl with a predilection for Shakespeare; his draft-dodger English teacher; a pair of golden boys stuck in emotional adolescence — several versions of truth emerge and combine. As the story unfolds, so does a portrait of a community driven and oppressed by clichés of gender, strength and beauty, family and love.

Romantiques par la mélancolie à lombre de laquelle ils sépanouissent, parnassiens par leur culte du Beau et la rigueur de leur composition (ils sont dédiés à Théophile Gautier), ces poèmes illustrent la théorie des correspondances horizontales entre les éléments visibles et invisibles, qui sont comme de longs échos qui de loin en loin se confondent pour sélever en correspondances verticales ayant lexpansion des choses infinies. Exploration du matériau grouillant quest la vie, cette quête spirituelle conduit le poète, tiraillé entre Spleen et Idéal, à travers diverses expériences pour échapper à la dualité déchirante. Lamour, un temps envisagé, est bien vite écarté au profit de lactivité qui caractérise les Tableaux parisiens. Mais la contemplation urbaine sachève sur la vision presque hallucinatoire des brouillards matinaux. Viennent alors Le Vin et autres plaisirs artificiels, puis le vice, fleurs du mal qui noffrent que mirage et dégoût. Dans une ultime tentative pour échapper au spleen, le poète pousse un cri de Révolte blasphématoire dont les répétitions ne sont plus des échos incantatoires, mais des piétinements stériles.

But Vladimir Nabokovs wise, ironic, elegant masterpiece owes its stature as one of the twentieth centurys novels of record not to the controversy its material aroused but to its authors use of that material to tell a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness.Awe and exhilaration–along with heartbreak and mordant wit–abound in this account of the aging Humbert Humberts obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America, but most of all, it is a meditation on love–love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.

0747549923,Last Exit to Brooklyn,"Few novels have caused as much debate as Hubert Selby Jr.s notorious masterpiece, Last Exit to Brooklyn, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting.Described by various reviewers as hellish and obscene, Last Exit to Brooklyn tells the stories of New Yorkers who at every turn confront the worst excesses in human nature. Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. Last Exit to Brooklyn was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer. In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream was adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.Last Exit to Brooklyn will explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 yearsAllen GinsbergAn urgent tickertape from hellSpectator",55,277,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0747549923.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

From his respirator, Verger monitors every twitch in his worldwide web.

0521427150,"Belonging in the Two Berlins : Kin, State, Nation (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology)","Belonging in the two Berlins is an ethnographic investigation into the meaning of German selfhood during the Cold War. Taking the practices of everyday life in the divided Berlin as his point of departure, Borneman shows how ideas of kin, state, and nation were constructed through processes of mirror-imaging and misrecognition. Using linguistics and narrative analysis, he compares the autobiographies of two generations of Berlins residents with the official version of the lifecourse prescribed by the two German states. He examines the relation of the dual political structure to everyday life, the way in which the two states legally regulated the lifecourse in order to define the particular categories of self which signify Germanness, and how citizens experientially appropriated the frameworks provided by these states. Living in the two Berlins constantly compelled residents to define themselves in opposition to their other half. Borneman argues that this resulted in a de facto divided Germany with two distinct nations and peoples. The formation of German subjectivity since World War II is unique in that the distinctive features for belonging - for being at home - to one side exclude the other. Indeed, these divisions inscribed by the Cold War account for many of the problems in forging a new cultural unity.",80,316,1992,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0521427150.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

039914563X,The Bear and the Dragon,"
Time and again, Tom Clancys novels have been praised not only for their big-scale drama and propulsive narrative drive but for their cutting-edge prescience in predicting future events.

In The Bear and the Dragon, the future is very near at hand indeed.Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; theres a revolution in Liberia; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR--the former KGB--with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?Ryan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail...the consequences will be unspeakable.Blending the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, razor-sharp suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters, this is Clancy at his best--and there is none better.",40,324,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/039914563X.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
0688048730,Thinking on paper,"Most books on writing assume that the sole purpose of writing is communication. These manuals seldom go beyond teaching how to avoid the problems of punctuation, grammar, and style that at one time or another ensnare the best of writers. Few, if any, of these books explore writing as a way of shaping thought.V.A. Howard and J.H. Barton, two Harvard researchers in education, take a radically different approach. While they agree with their predecessors that an important function of writing is the clear, direct expression of thought, they point out that many of our thoughts first come into being only when put to paper. By failing to recognize the link between thinking and writing, we fall into the deadlock innappropriately named writers block.Thinking on Paper shows how writers block as well as many other writing problems are engendered by the tendency, supported by traditional approaches, to separate thinking from writing. Drawing on the developing field of symbol theory, Howard and Barton explain why this sepapration is unsound and demonstrate how to improve dramatically our ability to generate and express ideas. For everyone who writes, this is a readable, accessible manual of immense educational and practical value.",40,325,1986,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780688048730-us.jpg

0440224829,Granny Dan,"In my eyes she had always been old, always been mine, always been Granny Dan. But in another time, another place, there had been dancing, people, laughter, love. . . . She had had another life before she came to us, long before she came to me. . . .She was the cherished grandmother who sang songs in Russian, loved to roller-skate, and spoke little of her past. But when Granny Dan died, all that remained was a box wrapped in brown paper, tied with string. Inside, an old pair of satin toe shoes, a gold locket, and a stack of letters tied with ribbon. It was her legacy, her secret past, waiting to be discovered by the granddaughter who loved her but never really knew her. It was a story waiting to be told. . . .The year was 1902. A new century was dawning as a motherless young girl arrived at a ballet school in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the age of seven. By age seventeen, Danina Petroskova had become a great ballerina, a favorite of the Czar and Czarina, who welcomed her into the heart of the Imperial family. But events both near and far away shook the ground upon which she danced. A war, an extraordinary man, and a devastating illness altered the course of her life. And when revolution shattered Russia, Danina Petroskova was forced to make a heartbreaking choice--as the world around her was about to change forever.Granny Dan is about the magic of history. In it, Danielle Steel reminds us how little we know of those who came before us--and how, if we could only glimpse into their early lives, and see who they once were, there is so much we would understand and learn. For in this extraordinary novel, a simple box, filled with mementos from a grandmother, offers the greatest legacy of all: an unexpected gift of a life transformed, a long-forgotten history of youth and beauty, love and dreams.",25,327,2000,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/0440224829.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
